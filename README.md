# A Short Course on LaTeX for Linguists

This repository contains the code and associated files for a _Short Course on LaTeX for Linguists_ which I taught with [Robert Henderson](http://rhenderson.net/) at the University of California, Santa Cruz [Department of Linguistics](http://linguistics.ucsc.edu/) in the Fall of 2009. No updates have been made to these materials since then, but they are of some use to people, still, so they are preserved here for posterity.

## File Contents

* `#.tex & #.pdf`: source files and resulting pdfs for seven demonstrative LaTeX documents. Viewing them in sequence _is_ the course.
* `demobib.bib`: A sample bibliography for use with Lesson 7.
* `english5stepcorrect.eps` & `waveform.eps`: Sample images for use in Lesson 6.
* `errmessage.png`: A screenshot of the best error ever from LaTeX.
* `ucscling.sty`: A style file I wrote in 2009 that provides an example of personal macro customization loaded as a package.
* `rootsAndFixedProsody_FINAL.tex`: a text of a paper I wrote in 2009/10 which provides an example of a maximally complex LaTeX document.
* `latexexamples.tex`: a set of example syntax trees using [pst-jtree](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/contrib/pst-jtree?lang=en)
